# PasswordGenerator-Python

This is one of my first python scrips
it takes a Site/Game name and the desired amount of characters you want for your password, Generates a password, prints it
and saves it to a file, then whenever the program is lauched
it will read the file that contains your Site/Game and your password and displays them ocordingly

Don't be dumb, have python installed to run this script, the .bat file will lauch it from here, but using the console works just the same

if you are just running it, keep it in the zip it came with, otherwise it wont work:( i dont wanna fix it so thats how it works lol
